# Introduction To Neural Networks
 A Primer on Neural Networks with introductory examples. Following various statistical regression models, these notes focus on the mathematics behind the various layers and activation functions one can choose when designing a neural network. These notes have been supplemented with many Python Jupyter notebooks, where all examples from the notes have been implemented using the Keras API of TensorFlow2.
